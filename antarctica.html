          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Speculation over the existence of a "southern land" was not confirmed until the early <time datetime="1820s">1820s</time> when British and American commercial operators and British and Russian national expeditions began exploring the Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas south of the Antarctic Circle. Not until <time datetime="1840">1840</time> was it established that Antarctica was indeed a continent and not merely a group of islands or an area of ocean.</p>
          <p>Several exploration "firsts" were achieved in the early 20th century, but generally the area saw little human activity. Following World War II, however, the continent experienced an upsurge in scientific research. A number of countries have set up a range of year-round and seasonal stations, camps, and refuges to support scientific research in Antarctica. Seven have made territorial claims, but most countries do not recognize these claims.</p>
          <p>In order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the continent, an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies nor gives recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in <time datetime="1959">1959</time>, it entered into force in <time datetime="1961">1961</time>. Also relevant to Antarctic governance are the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.</p>

          <h3>Legal System</h3>
          <p>Antarctica is administered through annual meetings - known as Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings - which include consultative member nations, non-consultative member nations, observer organizations, and expert organizations. Decisions from these meetings are carried out by these member nations (with respect to their own nationals and operations) in accordance with their own national laws. More generally, the Antarctic Treaty area, that is to all areas between 60 and 90 degrees south latitude, is subject to a number of relevant legal instruments and procedures adopted by the states party to the Antarctic Treaty.</p>
          <p><abbr title="United States">US law</abbr>, including certain criminal offenses by or against US nationals, such as murder, may apply extraterritoriality; some US laws directly apply to Antarctica; for example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 <abbr title="United States Code">U.S.C.</abbr> section 2401 <abbr title="et sequens">et seq.</abbr>, provides civil and criminal penalties for the following activities unless authorized by regulation or statute.</p>
          <p>Violation of the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines and one year in prison; the National Science Foundation and Department of Justice share enforcement responsibilities; Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of <time datetime="1978">1978</time>, as amended in <time datetime="1996">1996</time>, requires expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room 2665, Department of State, Washington, <abbr title="District of Columbia">DC</abbr> 20520, which reports such plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty.</p>

          <p>The general assessment for telecommunication systems is that there are local systems at some research stations.</p>
          <p>On a domestic level, commercial cellular networks operate in a small number of locations.</p>
          <P>On an international level, this is no country code allocated but satallites are used to and from research stations, ships, aircraft and most field parties.</p>
